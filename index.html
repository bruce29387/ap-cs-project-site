  <h2>Mad Libs Function</h2>
  <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/892438775https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/892438775">Mad Libs Link</a></p>
  <p>The Mad Libs project began to introduce the class to more advanced scratch and certain blocks. While this project is very straightforward to enter the word, complete the sentence, its whole purpose of introducing us to more advanced code has helped majorly when completing harder projects.</p>

    <h2>Custom Shapes</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898520714/">Custom Shape Link</a></p>
    <p> While the polygon generator was not a very challenging project, it provided a good introduction to 2 person coding. The goal was to create a triangle, square, pentagon, and hexagon. We also created the opportunity to choose the size and the amount of sides of the shape.</p>

    <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=mtebtm&projectname=max%20and%20min">Maximum and Minnimum</a></p>
    <p>This project was the most difficult of all included projects, requiring collaboration of me and my partner. Our goal was to create code for the Maximum and Minimum of a list and two numbers, being able to identify an integer and finding the sum of a list. The challenges of this helped me and my partner learn how to collaborate, and the complexity created a new learning experience for our group.</p>

    <h2>Pico Project</h2>
    <p>In this project we used a pico and thonny to code a stoplight in python, then importing this code into the pico along with neopixel. This allowed the pico to light up and created a working and functional stoplight</p>

      <p>For this project Kai Chao and I created a app that allows the user to add item to their shopping list, while alos giving the user the ability to remove items from their shopping list. This app also organized the users items by price for ease of use for the user.</p>
