  <p>The Mad Libs project began to introduce the class to more advanced scratch and certain blocks. While this project is very straightforward to enter the word, complete the sentence, its whole purpose of introducing us to more advanced code has helped majorly when completing harder projects.</p>

    <p> While the polygon generator was not a very challenging project, it provided a good introduction to 2 person coding. The goal was to create a triangle, square, pentagon, and hexagon. We also created the opportunity to choose the size and the amount of sides of the shape.</p>

    <p>This project was the most difficult of all included projects, requiring collaboration of me and my partner. Our goal was to create code for the Maximum and Minimum of a list and two numbers, being able to identify an integer and finding the sum of a list. The challenges of this helped me and my partner learn how to collaborate, and the complexity created a new learning experience for our group.</p>
