  <p> I grew up into a very competitive family, with everyone having done competitive sports at one point, and most having also coached at one point or currently. This allowed me to learn early about how to succeed and the effort you need to put into school and sports. This majorly helps me handle my classes, including the many projects from this one.</p>
